## Examples of Usage

Login to Amazon ECR Private, then build and push a Docker image:
```yaml
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      id: login-ecr
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

    - name: Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
        REPOSITORY: my-ecr-repo
        IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
      run: |
        docker build -t $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
        docker push $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
```

Login to Amazon ECR Public, then build and push a Docker image:
```yaml
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR Public
      id: login-ecr-public
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
      with:
        registry-type: public

    - name: Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR Public
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr-public.outputs.registry }}
        REGISTRY_ALIAS: my-ecr-public-registry-alias
        REPOSITORY: my-ecr-public-repo
        IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
      run: |
        docker build -t $REGISTRY/$REGISTRY_ALIAS/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
        docker push $REGISTRY/$REGISTRY_ALIAS/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
```

Login to Amazon ECR Private, then package and push a Helm chart:
```yaml
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      id: login-ecr
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

    - name: Package and push helm chart to Amazon ECR
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
        REPOSITORY: my-ecr-repo
      run: |
        helm package $REPOSITORY
        helm push $REPOSITORY-0.1.0.tgz oci://$REGISTRY
```

Login to Amazon ECR Public, then package and push a Helm chart:
```yaml
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR Public
      id: login-ecr-public
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
      with:
        registry-type: public

    - name: Package and push helm chart to Amazon ECR Public
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr-public.outputs.registry }}
        REGISTRY_ALIAS: my-ecr-public-registry-alias
        REPOSITORY: my-ecr-public-repo
      run: |
        helm package $REPOSITORY
        helm push $REPOSITORY-0.1.0.tgz oci://$REGISTRY/$REGISTRY_ALIAS
```

Helm uses the same credential store as Docker. So Helm can authenticate with the same credentials that you use for Docker.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.

## Credentials and Region

### AWS Credentials

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.  Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with a role using GitHub's OIDC provider and your desired region.

```yaml
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-github-actions-role
        aws-region: us-east-1

    - name: Login to Amazon ECR Private
      id: login-ecr
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
```

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) when using AWS services in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
* [Assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#delegate-using-roles) to receive temporary credentials. See the [Sample IAM Role CloudFormation Template](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#sample-iam-role-cloudformation-template) in the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action to get an example.
* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.

### Docker Credentials
The registry URIs for ECR Private and ECR Public are as follows:
- Registry URI for ECR Private: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.aws-region-1.amazonaws.com`
- Registry URI for ECR Public: `public.ecr.aws`

After logging in, you can access the docker username and password via action outputs using the following format:

If using ECR Private:
- Docker username output: `docker_username_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`
- Docker password output: `docker_password_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`

If using ECR Public:
- Docker username output: `docker_username_public_ecr_aws`
- Docker password output: `docker_password_public_ecr_aws`

To push Helm charts, you can also login through Docker. By default, Helm can authenticate with the same credentials that you use for Docker.

## Permissions

### ECR Private

To see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).

This action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Private:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GetAuthorizationToken",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Docker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker pull` and `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action.

The following minimum permissions are required for pulling an image from an ECR Private repository:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPull",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-ecr-repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following minimum permissions are required for pushing and pulling images in an ECR Private repository:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPushPull",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
        "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
        "ecr:PutImage",
        "ecr:UploadLayerPart"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-ecr-repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ECR Public

To see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/security-iam.html).


This action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Public:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GetAuthorizationToken",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken",
        "sts:GetServiceBearerToken"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Docker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action. There are no permissions needed for pulling images from ECR Public.

The following minimum permissions are required for pushing an image to an ECR Public repository:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPush",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr-public:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
        "ecr-public:CompleteLayerUpload",
        "ecr-public:InitiateLayerUpload",
        "ecr-public:PutImage",
        "ecr-public:UploadLayerPart"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr-public:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-ecr-public-repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Configure credentials

`Inaccessible host: 'api.ecr-public.us-east-2.amazonaws.com' at port 'undefined'. This service may not be available in the 'us-east-2' region.`

- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as a region where ECR Public isn't available.
- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.

`GetAuthorizationToken command is only supported in us-east-1.`

- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as `us-west-2`.
- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.

### Inputs

`Invalid parameter at 'registryIds' failed to satisfy constraint: 'Member must satisfy constraint: [Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: [0-9]{12}]'`

- One of the registries you provided in the `registries` input isn't a sequence of 12 digits
- For users providing only a single registry ID in the `registries` input, if the ID begins with a 0, make sure to enclose it in quotes. GitHub Actions will read an input as a number if all of the characters in the input are digits. So if your registry ID begins with a 0, the 0 will be truncated. See issue [#225](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login/issues/225).
